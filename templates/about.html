    The rules now known as the Bechdel test first appeared in 1985 in Alison Bechdel's comic strip Dykes
    To Watch Out For. In a strip titled "The Rule", two women discuss seeing a film and one woman explains that she only goes to a movie if it satisfies the following requirements:
    <ol>
        <li>The movie has to have at least two women in it,</li>
        <li>who talk to each other,</li>
        <li>about something besides a man</li>
    </ol>
